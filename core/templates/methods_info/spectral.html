affinity matrix between samples, followed by clustering, e.g., by KMeans,
of the components of the eigenvectors in the low dimensional space.
It is especially computationally efficient if the affinity matrix is sparse
and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amg</span></code> solver is used for the eigenvalue problem (Note, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amg</span></code> solver
requires that the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg">pyamg</a> module is installed.)</p>

<p>The present version of SpectralClustering requires the number of clusters
to be specified in advance. It works well for a small number of clusters,
but is not advised for many clusters.</p>

<p>For two clusters, SpectralClustering solves a convex relaxation of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/SM-ncut.pdf">normalised cuts</a>
problem on the similarity graph: cutting the graph in two so that the weight of
the edges cut is small compared to the weights of the edges inside each
cluster. This criteria is especially interesting when working on images, where
graph vertices are pixels, and weights of the edges of the similarity graph are
computed using a function of a gradient of the image.</p>
